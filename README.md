# Tic Tac Toe Game in Python
## Overview
Have you attempted to develop the widely known game, tic-tac-toe, using the Python programming language? We're going to build a complete tic-tac-toe project in Python, applying the skills we've learned throughout our Python tutorial. Tic-tac-toe in Python is a two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Each player selects either X or O, and the first player begins by placing their symbol on an empty space on the grid. This continues alternately until one player successfully creates a line of their symbols on the grid, or if all spaces are filled, resulting in a draw.

## What We are building?
We'll apply our Python skills acquired from the scaler module by linking them to the Python module to develop the tic-tac-toe project. We'll break down the project into steps to facilitate comprehension as we simultaneously construct the game.

Python Tic Tac Toe, also recognized as Noughts and Crosses or Xs and Os, is a straightforward game for two players. Each player selects either X or O to mark their moves on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their symbols on the board until one achieves a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbol, as illustrated below, resulting in victory. If all spots on the grid are filled without a winning line being formed, the game ends in a draw.
